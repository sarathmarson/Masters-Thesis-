# Master's Thesis:- Effects of Transfer Learning on Chess Piece Recognition

This repository contains detailed overview of my master's thesis- 'Effects of Transfer Learning on Chess Piece Recognition'. 


## Steps 
Following are the steps required to perform chess piece recognition using my algorithm.

### Clone reference repository

The steps for performing detection using YOLOv3 is described in detail in https://github.com/zzh8829/yolov3-tf2 . This repsoitory is cloned in to our colab working environemnt using the following operation: 

    !git clone https://github.com/zzh8829/yolov3-tf2.git

### Clone the thesis repository into reference repository

Then, the python scripts given in this repository are cloned into the above repository. For cloning this repsoitory into colab, use the command shown below:

    !git clone https://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@github.com/sarathmarson/Masters-Thesis-.git
    
### Weights of datasets

The trained weights of three different datasets can be downloaded from the links given below:

First chessboard data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aqGtr6g33wydPfuyJZREFyp73YHcrW3N?usp=sharing

Second chessboard data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OvPxm3VnZXlhcpKXZjSb9Vn5Anttiq1Z?usp=sharing

Mixed dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gsqf2lcHBDezKyWK3WORbgXg9UxSNNbL?usp=sharing

### Output obtained using the detection algorithm

The output obtained for first chessboard using the trained weights of first chessbaord data is illustrated in :
